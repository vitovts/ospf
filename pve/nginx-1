Proxy the Proxmox Web GUI with Nginx Over HTTPS with Load Balancing

Redirect HTTP requests to use the HTTPS protocol.
Add your own certificate to use for HTTPS.
Listen on the standard HTTPS port (port 443).


apt-get install nginx

rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/proxmox-gui


Add the below text to your proxmox-gui file. You will need to substitute some of the settings with your own values:

    ssl_certificate – this should point to your SSL certificate to use for signing the SSL traffic.
    ssl_certificate_key – is this key which matches the above certificate.
    server – this is the IP and port of your Proxmox server. If you have installed Nginx on the same host as the Proxmox web GUI then you could use https://localhost:8006 here.

upstream proxmox {
    server 10.10.10.10:8006;
}

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    rewrite ^(.*) https://$host$1 permanent;
}

server {
    listen 443;
    server_name _;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;
    proxy_redirect off;
    location / {
        proxy_pass https://proxmox;
    }
}

If you have multiple Proxmox servers in a cluster, it would make sense to use load balancing in Nginx. We don’t really want to use this feature to spread the load, because usually the traffic will be very light – we want to use it so that if one node in the cluster is down, Nginx will automatically try a different node in the cluster.

To add load balancing, add your additional servers in the upstream proxmox code section. For example:

upstream proxmox {
    server 10.10.10.10:8006;
    server 10.10.10.11:8006;
    server 10.10.10.12:8006;
    }

We need to link the newly created config file so that Nginx can load it.

ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxmox-gui /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

The last step is to restart Nginx web server to pick up the new settings.

service nginx restart

Your Proxmox web GUI should now be available on the IP address of your Nginx server on the HTTPS protocol.
